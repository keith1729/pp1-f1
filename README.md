## 3. Technologies Used

- HTML 

HyperText Markup Language, is the standard markup language used for creating web pages. It defines the content and structure of web content by using predefined tags and attributes. These elements instruct web browsers on how to display page content, including headings, lists, images, and links. HTML is human-readable and serves as the foundation for building web pages.

- CSS

Cascading Style Sheets is a language designed to simplify the process of making web pages presentable. It allows you to apply styles to HTML documents, describing how a webpage should look by prescribing colors, fonts, spacing, and positioning. CSS is independent of HTML and can be used with any XML-based markup language. In essence, itâ€™s the magic that transforms plain HTML content into visually appealing and well-organized web pages!
